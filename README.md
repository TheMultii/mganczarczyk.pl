# mganczarczyk.pl website

This repo consists of the source code of my personal website. It's built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with a touch of [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

## Features

-   🪄 Minimalistic design
-   📱 Mobile friendly
-   🌙 Dark mode
-   ⚡ Fast thanks to static generation
-   🙅‍♂️ Doesn't require JavaScript to show content

## Development

To run the project locally get required nodejs version from `.tool-versions` and `bun`. Then run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheMultii/mganczarczyk.pl
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Deployment

The website is available at [mganczarczyk.pl](https://mganczarczyk.pl/) and/or [beta.mganczarczyk.pl](https://beta.mganczarczyk.pl/).
